  <h2>First of all... what is yoga?</h2>
 <p> Yoga can be traced back to India over 5,000 years ago. The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit word "Yuj" meaning union.<br>
  Yoga is a practice that hones endurance, flexibility, calmness and is good for ones overall well-being.</p> 
  <hr>
<h2><center> There are 6 types of yoga </center></h2>
  <h3> Hatha </h3>
  <p> "Yoga of force" Hatha is yoga that uses the physical body. "Ha" and "Tha" are often equated to the sun and moon respectively. The point of this form of yoga is to use the physical body to "force" change in the body and mind. </p>
  <h3> Raja </h3>
  <p> "Royal" Meditation is most important in Raja. Those who follow the path of Raja must adhere to the eight limbs of yoga all outlined in the Yoga Sutra by Patanajli in this order: 
  <ol>
        <li>ethical standards, <i>yama</i>; 
        <li>self-discipline, <i>niyama</i>; 
        <li>posture, <i>asana</i>;
        <li>breath extension or control, <i>Pranayama</i>;
        <li>sensory withdrawl, <i>pratyahara</i>;
        <li>concentration, <i>dharana</i>;
        <li>meditation, <i>dhyana</i>;
        <li>ecstasy or final liberation, <i>samadhi.</i></ol></p>
  <h3> Karma </h3>
  <p> "Yoga of action" Karma yoga is based on selflessness and acting for the betterment of the world around you. It's suggested focus on the "moment in action" and be very mindful of your deeds & words. Those who practice karma work in the present to benefit the future people and the world around them. </p>
  <h3> Bhakti </h3>
  <p> "Yoga of devotion" Bhakti yoga seeks to see the divine in all creations and attempt to accept everyone you meet. Bhakti also has eight limbs (anga) for each practitioner to adhere in no particular order.
      <ul>
       <li> Shravana’; or ‘listening’ to sacred scriptures
‘Kirtana’; ‘singing’ of devotional songs
<li> ‘Smarana’; ‘remembering’ the divine through meditation 
<li> ‘Pada-sevana’; ritual worship or ‘service at the feet of the Lord’ 
<li> ‘Vandana’; ‘prostration’ before the image of God; 
<li> ‘Dasya’; ‘slavish’ devotion to the Lord 
<li> ‘Sakhya’; ‘friendship’ through which the Divine raises the devotee to the status of a ‘friend’
<li> ‘Atma-nivedana’; ‘self-offering’. </ul>
</p>
  <h3> Jnana </h3>
  <p> "Yoga of knowing" Jnana is about wisdom, the scholar and developing intellect via study. Jnana is the most direct yet difficult approach of yoga since you must study the text scriptures. </p>
  <h3> Tantra </h3>
  <p> Tantra is a branch of yoga that is often misunderstood. Tantra is a pathway of ritual. Practitioners see the divine in life around them and hold sexuality as sacred, set apart as almost holy. Practitioners are not completely celibate though as tantra allows and encourages mindful, purposeful, meaningful sex. Those who deeply enjoy ritual and celebrations are most suited for tantric yoga. </p>
